## Welcome to INDOLOGY

This website is an adjunct to the [INDOLOGY](https://list.indology.info/mailman/listinfo/indology) online discussion forum for classical South Asian studies. The forum was founded in 1990 by Dominik Wujastyk as a medium for exchange and debate by university-level research scholars. Since July 2001 the forum has been managed by a committee of active Indologists.
