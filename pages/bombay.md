*Look here for:*

- the official, authoritative electronic text of the Sanskrit epic
  [*Mahābhārata*](https://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/statement.html);
- the electronic text of the Sanskrit epic
  [*Rāmāyaṇa*](https://bombay.indology.info/ramayana/statement.html);
- the Rajasthani oral [epic of
  Pābūjī](https://bombay.indology.info/pabuji/statement.html) including
  a complete electronic [second edition of John Smith's *The epic of
  Pābūjī*](https://bombay.indology.info/pabuji/pabuji.pdf), as well as a
  collection of
  [audio](https://bombay.indology.info/pabuji/audio/index.html) and
  [video](https://bombay.indology.info/pabuji/video/index.html)
  extracts;
- a collection of [exam
  howlers](https://bombay.indology.info/howlers.html).

*In addition you can access a variety of*
[fonts](https://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/index.html) *and*
[programs](https://bombay.indology.info/software/programs/index.html)
*likely to be of interest to Indologists.* Functioning Windows
executables are now once again available for many of these programs.

The high-quality OpenType ["IndUni"
fonts](https://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html)
allow the representation of Indian-language (and similar) material in
Roman script using the Unicode character set. The fonts contain all the
accented characters that Indologists are likely to need, as well as all
common European accented characters, and many others too.

Two [Devanagari
fonts](https://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/devanagari/index.html)
are available. Nakula and Sahadeva are "twin" Devanagari fonts, which
have been developed by IMRC, India, for the University of Cambridge.
Both fonts are TrueType/OpenType, and are Unicode compliant. Both
contain all the conjuncts and other ligatures (including Vedic accents)
likely to be needed by Sanskritists. Nakula follows the Bombay style of
Devanagari, with rounded glyphs and little thin/thick variation.
Sahadeva is in the Calcutta style, with more angular glyphs and greater
contrast between thin and thick strokes. The actual shapes of some of
the glyphs (e.g. initial "a", retroflex "ṇ") also differ according to
the style of the font.
