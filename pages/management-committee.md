The INDOLOGY Committee was established by Dominik Wujastyk in July 2001 for the purpose of 
regulating the membership and conduct of the INDOLOGY discussion forum and to devolve this 
responsibility to a group. Committee turnover is infrequent and 
membership is decided by the current committee members.
